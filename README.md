Coronavirus Tracking App.

This application was created based on JavaBrains tutorial with minor modifications. It's not entirely copy/paste from tutorial because source database changed since the moment of creation. Currently it shows a total number of cases for a previous day for every country/state + total number of cases worldwide based on data provided by John Hopkins University.  

TODO: add a verification if there is data avaiable for today - url validator

TODO: improve frontend of the application

TODO: add a possibility to check other epidemic characteristics (e.g. mortality/new cases)

TODO: add a possibility to check data from any day
